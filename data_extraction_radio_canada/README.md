## before all 
This is my first project on python and I hope not the last one. 
Directory contains the result of the script run at the date and time indicated on the title of the file.
## imports 
I imported  "requests" and "Beautifulsoup" libraries but they did'nt work on python version 3.11.1.
Worked fine on the 3.9.7 version

## project goals
* learning how python works
* learning how to get data from a website 
* get updated news from radio-canada, at the date and time the script is run

##### Merry christmas !!! ########
